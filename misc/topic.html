                <h1>Sensor technology to enable self-driving cars</h1>
                <p> In order for self-driving cars to make people's lives convenient and reduce accidents that are
                    currently occurring frequently on the road, cars should be able to sense not only the front but also
                    the surroundings at 360° and know what is happening around them. To do so, it is necessary to
                    integrate various types of sensor mechanisms with automobiles. Some of these are already being used
                    in advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) today, and others are emerging as self-driving cars. It
                    would not be possible to automate a car without using sensors. The six steps of autonomy, from
                    human-driven cars to full self-driving cars, are more specifically desired in the portability
                    section. In this website, we look at sensor technology that enables self-driving cars.</p>

            <h1>Sensor Mechanism</h1>
            <p>There are three representative technologies that allow autonomous vehicles to detect their surroundings.
                It's
                a
                lidar, a camera, a radar. Currently, each of these technologies is in a different development stage.</p>

            <img src="/Website/images/mechanism.jpg">
            <p>Comparison of sensor technologies used in self-driving cars
                The simplest of these is radar. Radar is already being used for functions such as adaptive driving
                control.
                Radar can also play an important role for self-driving cars. In particular, low-speed situations such as
                parking
                and slow-down are mentioned. It can also be used for functions that are executed at high speed, such as
                lane
                change on highways.

                A millimeter wave (mmWave) car radar system, which is an electromagnetic wave with a wavelength of 1 to
                10
                millimeters and a frequency of 30,000 to 300,000 megahertz (MHz), can calculate the distance, speed, and
                relative angle of an object using short wave electromagnetic waves. In general, it operates in a
                frequency
                band
                of 77 gigahertz (GHz) and can distinguish up to very small movements.

                In particular, the advantages of radar can be various. As a proven technology, it can operate reliably
                regardless of changes in environmental conditions. It is relatively inexpensive because the hardware is
                compact
                and achieves economies of scale as an industry-established technology.

                But there are also fundamental limitations. Among them, the most important thing is the amount of data
                that
                can
                be provided. For this reason, it is necessary to combine a series of sensors rather than relying on only
                one
                sensor method for autonomous vehicles.

                Lidar is a technology that almost all automakers currently include in their development programs, which
                can
                complement the car radar system. When a light pulse is emitted from a laser light source, the light is
                reflected
                by hitting an object. The distance to the object can be calculated using the time each of these pulses
                returns
                to the starting point.

                This process can be repeated millions of times per second to create a real-time 3D map of the
                surrounding
                environment. By doing so, you can identify other cars, road infrastructure, bicycles, pedestrians, and
                drive
                away from obstacles. Compared to other sensor methods, the biggest advantage of lidar is that it can
                generate a
                bird's eye view, providing a more comprehensive view.

                Ford is already investing heavily in this technology. The company is Velodyne's HDL-64E line for ongoing
                self-driving car development and testing It is using the system, and the first model to adopt the system
                will be
                released sometime in 2021.

        <div class="HDL" style='text-indent:15px'>
            <h1>LiDAR</h1>
            <img src="/Website/images/HDL.JPG">
            <p> The HDL-64E is a 64-channel system featuring a 360° horizontal viewing angle (FoV) and a distance of
                up
                to
                120
                meters at 26.9° vertical FoV. The number of channels supported is important in relation to the speed
                of
                the
                car.
                According to Velodine, vehicles with a 32-channel system can drive autonomously up to 57 kph, which
                can
                support
                much higher speeds by doubling the number of channels.

                The biggest obstacle to the supply of lidar is its high price. (That's why Elon Musk says Lidar is
                unnecessary)
                Currently, the LIDA system is priced at thousands of euros. Even if the size of the LIDA system
                increases,
                it is
                still expected to be very expensive.

                Price is not the only stumbling block. Lyda can accurately create maps around cars, but it does not
                provide
                the
                detail required for other purposes, such as road sign recognition. For such image recognition and
                classification
                work, a high-definition camera system should be used as an autonomous vehicle.

                <h1>Image sensors / Camera</h1>

                <img src="/Website/images/camera.JPG">
                <p>Cameras can be installed front, side, and rear by automobiles and screens can be connected to provide
                    a
                    360°
                    real-time view of the surroundings. By doing so, it is possible to minimize blind spots, inform that
                    the
                    speed
                    limit is changed, and maintain lanes. The number of cameras required will vary depending on the
                    system's
                    FoV
                    (up
                    to 120° possible) and whether you want to implement a fisheye camera (to provide a panoramic view
                    using
                    an
                    ultra-wide-angle lens).

                    Like any sensor technology, cameras should also consider both advantages and disadvantages. The
                    camera
                    system
                    may distinguish the surroundings in detail, but the depth and distance may be problematic. To
                    understand
                    the
                    exact location of the detected object, you need to know the distance to the object. In addition,
                    cameras
                    can
                    be
                    difficult to distinguish objects in poor visibility (such as bad weather or at night).

                    Another problem that system developers have begun to recognize is that sensor systems can affect
                    other
                    autonomous vehicles. Recently, discussions have been made on whether LIDA does not interfere with
                    the
                    operation
                    of the digital camera system. If so, it can be a serious problem (which could be life-threatening)
                    when
                    self-driving cars approach each other face to face.

                    Many studies are currently being actively conducted on how to combine sensors with self-driving cars
                    in
                    the
                    future. One thing is certain, each of the pros and cons can be compensated by combining various
                    methods
                    (radar,
                    image sensing, lidar, etc.). Various sensors can be combined to implement the various functions
                    required
                    for
                    self-driving cars,
                    while also achieving the redundancy required to make self-driving cars not dangerous.
