            <h1>Self-driving technology changes the landscape of the automobile industry.
            </h1>
            <p>Autonomous driving is not limited to the performance of individual vehicles. The main attraction of
                leaving machines to drive is that it is safer and can significantly reduce the number of deaths from
                traffic accidents (currently, the annual road deaths in the European Union exceed 25,000). In principle,
                various sensor devices that allow autonomous vehicles to detect and respond to risks faster than humans
                can be used to recognize and determine the surrounding environment.
            </p>
            <p>In addition, autonomous vehicles can communicate with each other, avoiding human driver malfunctions that
                can lead to vehicle-to-vehicle collisions. However, prior to this, the system needs to learn how the
                driver actually behaves.
            </p>
            <p>By applying machine learning technologies such as deep neural networks (DNNs), autonomous vehicles can
                access more data and learn better. Therefore, the autonomous driving system should be able to use
                large-scale data from various sources.
            </p>
            <p>This enhanced intelligence can be applied to both current and future cars through software updates. For
                example, Tesla has been collecting data from automobiles since its early days, and continues to compile
                data and provide it to various analytical activities.
            </p>
            <p>However, many moral issues arise here. What regulations should be in place regarding the collection of
                data and subsequent use of the data acquired while ensuring that it does not infringe on individual
                privacy? Who is allowed to collect, analyze, store and distribute vehicle data? How is the nature of the
                acquired data defined? Is there an abstraction layer applied to review possible trends without allowing
                access to an individual's identity? All of these issues are matters that must be decided and dealt with
                at the legislative level.
            </p>
        </div>

    <Data class="Data">
        <div class="Data"style='text-indent:15px'>
            <h1>Effective use of acquired data
            </h1>
            <p>Another problem that the engineering team that manufactures autonomous vehicles must overcome is the fact
                that nothing special usually happens in everyday driving. Fortunately, accidents are rare compared to
                the enormous amount of time cars spend moving along the road network. However, the system must be able
                to recognize these rare events and respond quickly.
            </p>
            <p>For this reason, simulation-based training is being actively used. A research team at Saarland University
                in Germany is developing a complex simulation environment designed to train artificial intelligence (AI)
                systems. These environments comprehensively present the combinations of abnormal and problematic events
                that the software of autonomous vehicles must address.
            </p>
            <p>Even with a comprehensive database, a key issue for simulation-based validation is determining how
                realistic each scenario is. Simulations using more stable sensor data may have an unexpected sensor
                failure mode that is confident that it does not interfere with the real system, while producing a
                completely different response.
            </p>
            <p>Autonomous vehicles should be taught not only from their own mistakes but also from other vehicles on the
                road. For this reason, cars record their experiences and upload them to the cloud, and AI models are
                constantly relearned. Potentially every night autonomous vehicles will be as safe as receiving new data
                for the next day's journey.
            </p>
            <p>However, daily records of daily journeys have a clear impact on personal information. The information
                obtained for the reasons mentioned briefly above needs to be anonymized so that the identity of the
                individual vehicle cannot be identified. This demand may become more important if car manufacturers
                start working in a more cooperative manner from their own proprietary, secretive development methods.
            </p>
            <p>If manufacturers continue to work in their own facilities, each company must come up with its own set of
                scenarios and identify the ones that require the most attention. Or if you want to improve overall
                safety with more comprehensive data, governments and businesses can decide to work together to develop a
                common training package.
            </p>
            <p>The method of changing the operation of the system by learning may vary depending on more than informing
                the AI system of the vehicle with only a sensor. Higher-level decisions are likely to work, and it is
                clear that the underlying framework on which these decisions are based will be a source of controversy
                (whose safety should be prioritized in situations where the loss of life is expected)? Implementing a
                universal framework is in the midst of philosophical debate and issues.

            <h1>The major stages of self-driving cars
            </h1>
            <p>Most car manufacturers have been making all-out efforts to develop fully self-driving cars for years now.
                The development of these autonomous driving technologies is being promoted not only by targeting the
                consumer base looking forward to the latest technology advances, but also by the need to meet future
                mobility needs and improve road user safety.
            </p>
            <p>The population is growing, the city is getting bigger and crowded, and the road network is getting more
                congested. On top of that, it is undeniable that drivers account for the majority of road accidents, and
                accordingly, the need to use intelligent technology to help us take us to our destinations is
                increasing.
            </p>
            <p>If you simply call a car with a smartphone app, wait for the vehicle to arrive at the door, get on, and
                check how the world works, the road to a fully autonomous car that arrives at the desired place will not
                be simple. The sensor mechanisms, software, and connectivity hardware required for fully autonomous
                vehicles are very sophisticated, expensive, and actually not yet fully defined.
            </p>
            <p>While engineering challenges are still being addressed, steps to a fully autonomous vehicle have already
                been presented. In 2014, the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) published a six-step definition of
                autonomous driving in the J3016 standard for the classification and definition of terms associated with
                autonomous driving systems. This standard has been revised to reflect developments so far.
            </p>

    <Steps class="Steps">
        <div class="Steps"style='text-indent:15px'>
            <h1>Six Steps to Self-Driving
            </h1>
            <p>We have already passed the first two stages of autonomous driving. In SAE standards, step 0 is simple.
                The vehicle is always controlled by the driver, and there is no significant auxiliary system involved.
                The driver performs steering, acceleration and braking, looks at the surrounding environment, and is
                responsible for all dynamic tasks (such as lane change on highways or overtaking other vehicles)
            </p>
            <img src="/Website/images/6levels.jpg">
            <p>Stage 1 is the level at which the limited driver support system begins to integrate, but the
                responsibility still lies with the driver. Smart cruise control and lane-departure warnings can help to
                some extent, but drivers should remain vigilant as so much depends on the driver behind the wheel. The
                driver should be fully aware of the surrounding environment and respond to any changes or risks, such as
                speed limits and road conditions.
            </p>
            <p>The boundaries begin to blur beyond step 1, the definitions used by different manufacturers may differ
                somewhat. Tesla, one of the most talked-about companies, often argues that autopilot technology is a
                system that provides autonomous driving. Tesla takes a number of examples of people sitting in the
                driver's seat of a car that is driving with their feet off the pedals without holding the wheel.
                However, engineers from other companies' autonomous systems development will actually say that Tesla's
                technology is between Phase 2 and Phase 3 without exaggeration.
            </p>
            <p>In a true two-stage system, a number of functions (such as some of the functions mentioned above) work
                together to provide what can be called partial automation. These systems can assist with steering and
                acceleration/deceleration and perform this by using smart cruise control and lane-keeping. The driver
                should always be careful in case of sudden changes in the surroundings and still be responsible for the
                dynamic driving task, so the driver should place his hand on the steering wheel.
            </p>
            <p>When the third stage is reached, conditional autonomous driving will appear from now on. The car begins
                to look at the surroundings, and the driver can relax a little more. In this stage, on-board systems
                such as traffic congestion aid access contextual data and control acceleration, steering, and braking
                accordingly. For example, in highway situations, a car can drive without human intervention. It should
                be noted that the driver should always be prepared and then be able to intervene if the technology
                cannot cope with the proposed driving scenario.
            </p>
            <p>When you reach stage four, something really exciting happens. Pedals and steering wheels are optional,
                and the need for driver intervention is dramatically reduced. At this stage, the car is responsible for
                accelerating, braking, steering and monitoring the surrounding environment (if the driver ignores the
                request for intervention) and performs dynamic driving tasks to maintain road user safety, stopping
                completely if necessary.
            </p>
            <p>The ultimate purpose of autonomous vehicle technology is a car that can operate in any driving mode in
                the face of any situation. In this case, we're finally at level five. The relevant onboard systems can
                perform steering, acceleration, and braking actions without any human intervention, look at the
                surroundings and perform all dynamic driving tasks in any environment or road conditions faced by the
                vehicle.
            </p>
            <p>The last two stages of an autonomous driving system rely heavily on a wide range of sensors integrated
                into the vehicle. These sensors allow the vehicle to read and respond to anything occurring around it.
                Moving from Stage 4 to Stage 5, the scope of the technology will expand further and include a high-speed
                wireless communication protocol. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a next-generation network that
                can take ultra-low latency data from other vehicles and road infrastructure (smart traffic signals,
                camera equipment, etc.) and enhance information on high-definition maps.
            </p>
            <p>The definition of various stages of an autonomous vehicle is an indicator of what can be expected when
                each stage is reached. The meaning and description of the steps that have not yet come will be adjusted
                as the hardware and software that support them is developed. Similarly, the expected time frame for each
                step is not fixed at all. The whole concept of fully autonomous driving should be regarded as a fluid
                that develops and adapts just like the underlying technology.
