            <h1>Basic Ethics of Self-Driving
            </h1>
            <p>We get in the car, take the wheel, and think only about where the destination is, how long it will take,
                and which way is good to avoid traffic congestion. However, you can encounter unexpected situations on
                the way to your destination, and you should respond appropriately according to each situation.
            </p>
            <p>For example, a car next to you may suddenly cut in, or a child may jump onto the road. In order to avoid
                serious consequences in the face of this situation, we must quickly judge and take action. With this
                measure, the brake may be applied, or the handle may be turned to avoid the collision.
            </p>
            <p>Self-driving cars will be able to avoid dangerous situations faster than drivers by utilizing advanced 3D
                imaging technologies (Lida and ToF) or by utilizing road infrastructure and data from other road users
                (V2V/V2I communication).
            </p>
            <p>In the event of an accident, the driver can make wrong judgments and respond carelessly regardless of the
                long and short driving experience, but self-driving cars do not. However, in some situations, fatal
                injuries may be inevitable.
                In this situation, ethically difficult dilemmas can be raised to determine how self-driving cars will
                cope.
            </p>
            <p>Automakers, primary partners, and chip companies are all investing heavily in designing and developing
                the hardware needed to realize a fully autonomous vehicle. As systems become more sophisticated and
                autonomous, a whole new level of ethical issues will be raised. This is a problem for road users, the
                legislature, and the industry alike.
                Much discussion should be made about how artificial intelligence (AI) technology will handle various
                crashes with next-generation cars, especially when cars have to make a number of important choices.
            </p>

        <div class="Life" style='text-indent:15px'>
            <h1>A matter of life
            </h1>
            <p>Many cases can be assumed in relation to this problem. For example, in an inevitable situation, you may
                have to choose whether to hit a bus carrying multiple people or turn the steering wheel on the sidewalk
                to hit a mother and child.
                This, of course, assumes an extreme case. However, the algorithms of self-driving cars should be able to
                handle even these situations quickly.
            </p>
            <p>Germany seems to be at the forefront of this issue at the moment. Germany has already established a code
                of ethics for self-driving cars. In 2017, the ethics committee of the German Federal Ministry of
                Transportation and Digital Infrastructure produced a comprehensive report on automated and connected
                driving.
                The report describes the approaches to be taken in the face of extreme situations such as those
                mentioned above. According to this, it is stated that protecting a person's life should be the top
                priority in coordinating legally protected interests. Therefore, if a person can avoid getting hurt in a
                conflict situation, the system should be programmed to risk damage to animals or property.
            </p>
            <p>In the future, this hierarchical approach will be embodied as a criterion for universal implementation,
                with people at the top of their priorities and nonliving things at the bottom. It will also be
                prioritized according to the vulnerability of road users. For example, pedestrians will come first,
                followed by bicycles, cars, and commercial vehicles.
            </p>
            <p>However, German regulations prohibit age, gender, and physical and mental status from being classified
                when any inevitable situation occurs. If a situation occurs in which a collision with a person is
                unavoidable, the severity of the damage should be minimized (e.g., the number of victims, etc.).
                Some countries may not approve of this egalitarian approach, and ethical choices may differ from country
                to country that introduces them. A survey conducted by MIT looked at how one group's safety is more
                important than another in many parts of the world
            </p>
            <p>The Moral Machine Experiment, a platform to collect social awareness of ethical decisions of artificial
                intelligence such as self-driving cars, surveyed more than 2 million people in more than 200 countries.
                According to the test results, it was found that there was a general consensus that people should save
                their lives before animals, many people before few, and young people before the elderly.
            </p>
            <p>However, there were some differences between regions. For example, in some regions, the prevailing
                opinion was that young people should be protected before old people, whereas in Far Eastern countries,
                the percentage that old people should be protected first was dominant. Therefore, AI algorithms used in
                autonomous vehicles should be adapted to reflect regional cultural/ethical differences.

            <h1>Who will be responsible?
            </h1>
            <p>Another question to be clarified is who will be responsible in the event of an accident. It may be an
                automobile manufacturer, a software company that developed AI algorithms, or a telecommunications
                company that provides V2V/V2I communication.
                Or other parties involved in the development of cars or the operation of supporting infrastructure in
                some way.
            </p>
            <p>It can be difficult to investigate accidents by the entanglement of various officials, but another
                advantage of autonomous vehicles is that they can use a large amount of data on the surrounding
                conditions and operating conditions until an accident occurs.
                Already, California authorities require companies that test autonomous vehicles to submit 30 seconds of
                sensor data to the Bureau of Vehicles before any accident occurs. By doing so, it is much easier to
                reconstruct accidents than in cars today, and it is easier to identify who is responsible.
            </p>
            <p>The ultimate long-term goal of autonomous driving technology should be to eliminate accidents altogether.
                If only self-driving cars run on the road and all cars can communicate with other cars, they will be
                closer to this goal. However, bugs, service outages, hacking threats, and other situations in the code
                can still affect the safety of road users. This part can be found in more detail in the Ethical Issue
                section.
